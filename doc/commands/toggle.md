# Toggle Command

## Description

This command allows toggling of plugin functionality for players/worlds

## Usage Examples

/ta toggle spawn | toggle plugin usage for yourself in the world `spawn`

## Details

Toggling off means that even if players have the required tools, the trees will not replant or destruct automatically.

The only exception is if `Forced Removal` is activated. Then the plugin will always remove trees that are not fully broken.
