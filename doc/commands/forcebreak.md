# ForceBreak Command

## Description

This command breaks all trees around you in a certain range.

## Usage Examples

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/ta forcebreak | Break trees around you
/ta forcebreak 20 | Break trees in a 20 block radius around you

## Hazards

The plugin tries to discover what is a tree or is not, but be careful using this command. It could remove tree-like houses.

However, we did the best we can to ensure player dwellings are discovered through unnaturally placed blocks.

## Details

Set the maximal radius to be used with the config setting `Force Break Max Radius`, it is also the default radius when no number is specified.
