# TreeAssist Debug

If a bug is hard to find, we will ask you to run a debug. You can do this yourself, and often this will identify issues and help you fix them faster.

***

To run a debug, take the following steps:

1) [```/treeassist debug on```](commands/debug.md)
   

2) Repeat the action that caused the error or unexpected behaviour
   

3) [```/treeassist debug off```](commands/debug.md)
   

4) Look in the ```/plugins/treeassist/debug``` folder 

***

Inside the folder, you should find a log file. In case there are multiple files, please open the newest one.

The log file will contain information about what is going on and why the plugin could have reacted in an unexpected way.

If you cannot find the root of your problem, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kZzmAqzQ9j) and open a ticket in ```#treeassist-help```, and provide the log file together with answers to the questions below:

1) What is the expected behavior?


2) What does happen?
